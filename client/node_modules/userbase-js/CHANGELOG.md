## [1.4.1] - 2020-05-20
## Changed
- init() now returns immediately if the user's session has expired rather than make a request to the Userbase server to find out it has expired.

## [1.4.0] - 2020-05-04
## Added
- purchaseSubscription(), cancelSubscription(), resumeSubscription(), and updatePaymentMethod() functions to enable developers to accept subscription payments from their users.
- getDatabases() enables developers to get all of a user's databases.
- signUp(), signIn(), and init() return `paymentsMode`, the app's payments mode set by the admin, `creationDate`, the date the user was created, and `trialExpirationDate`, the date the user's trial expires.
- signIn() and init() return `subscriptionStatus`, the user's subscription status, and `cancelSubscriptionAt`, the date the user's subscription is set to be canceled.

## Fixed
- Network errors throw ServiceUnavailable instead of never returning.

## Changed
- openDatabase() now requires the user to pay for a subscription to an app that has payments enabled in the admin panel.

## [1.3.0] - 2020-04-02
## Added
- signUp(), signIn(), and init() return the user’s authToken which can be passed to a 3rd party server to verify the user is signed in to Userbase via the Admin API.
- browser compatibility list included in README along with a polyfill recommendation for Internet Explorer.

## Fixed
- init() throws WebCryptoUnavailable if the Web Crypto API is not available instead of ServiceUnavailable.

## Changed
- signIn() throws UserPendingDeletion if user tries to sign in while the user is pending deletion instead of UsernameOrPasswordMismatch.
- Axios dependency replaced by native XMLHttpRequest.
- Internal usage of .includes() replaced with .indexOf() !== -1 to support wider number of browsers without need for polyfill.

## Removed
- Babel runtime corejs3 dependency.
- ProfileKeyMustBeString error from signUp() and updateUser() since javascript automatically converts keys object keys to strings anyway.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-02-29
## Added
- signIn() and init() return the user’s protectedProfile which can be set via the Admin API server-side.

## [1.1.2] - 2020-02-23

## [1.1.1] - 2020-02-18
### Changed
- insertItem(), updateItem(), and putTransaction() now only throw ItemMissing if an `item` param is not explicitly provided.
- insertItem(), updateItem(), and putTransaction() with an item set to undefined (or any other data type that cannot be serialized to JSON via `JSON.stringify`) now throw ItemInvalid instead of throwing ItemMissing.

### Fixed
- signIn() with a username that includes a "`+`" character now works instead of throwing UsernameOrPasswordMismatch.
- insertItem(), updateItem(), and putTransaction() with an item set to false, null, 0, or a 0 length string now work instead of throwing ItemMissing.
- DatabaseNameTooLong and ItemIdTooLong error messages are now more accurate.
- OperationsExceedLimit now throws error status 400 (Bad Request) instead of 409 (conflict).


## [1.1.0] - 2020-02-10
### Added

- signIn() returns usedTempPassword boolean.
- SDK functions throw "Missing" error when a required parameter is left off the params object.

- falsey profile object values (null, undefined, 0, or false) now throw ProvileValueMustBeString.
